//! Motion-path assembly: turning raw geometry primitives into Ops.
//!
//! Functions in this module compose geo-layer primitives (polylines,
//! arcs, polygons) into complete motion sequences represented as
//! [`crate::ops::Ops`] objects. They decide traversal order, linking
//! strategy, lead-in/out, overscan, and tab insertion — concerns that
//! belong to motion assembly rather than pure geometry.
//!
//! ## The `Assembler` trait
//!
//! Each assembler under this module exposes a **spec struct** (e.g.
//! [`contour::ContourSpec`], [`adaptive::AdaptiveClearingSpec`]) that
//! implements [`Assembler`]. Callers drive any assembler through this
//! trait, mirroring how `ops::transform` drives post-processors
//! through the `Transformer` trait. Both traits take their
//! callbacks from [`crate::ops::callbacks`].
